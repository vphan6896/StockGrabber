# StockGrabber
https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/

Simply queried the api for stock symbols and outputted toa json format (spaced to be more organized).
Used this script to grab approximately 1000 stocks and the total allotted time comes out to be .11 seconds
Do note I ran this on a gaming computer on a Gigabit ethernet connection. Further optimizations can be made with
string concatenations perhaps.
